    <h1>About Stupidly Simple Recipes</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
        Frankly speaking, most recipe sites out on the internet today are unnavigable for beginners. 
        Countless times have I been fumbling about in my kitchen sporting hands caked with ingredients, fruitlessly
        trying to close out popups and ads that keep obscuring the instructions. Not to mention the essays about
        the origins of whatever you're making, making just trying to find the dang instructions a burden all on its own.

        Stupidly Simple Recipes aims to bring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank">
        KISS principle</a> to the world of cooking. We provide a short description of what you'll be cooking +
        instructions that don't get in your way, so you can focus on honing your cooking skills with a delicious
        reward at the end. Lastly for all you tech nerds out there, this is (I think) the first ever fully open source
        recipe website! If you are inclined to contribute in any way, I would recommend you checkout 
        <a href="/contributing">this page</a>.

        Happy Cooking!
